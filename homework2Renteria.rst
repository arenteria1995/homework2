1 meter = 39 3/8 inches (reference 1)

1 mile = 5280 ft (reference 2)

1 mile = 1609 11/32 meters (reference 3)

Circumference of the Earth = 24901 miles (reference 4)


"*yotta*" something = 10^24 times something (reference 5)

"*kilo*" something = 10^3 times something (reference 5)

"*hecto*" something = 100 times something (reference 5)

"*deka*" something = 10 times something (reference 5)

something = something (duh!)

milli something = 1/10^3 (reference 5)

micro something = 1/10^6 (reference 5)

nano something = 1/10^9 (reference 5)

"*pico*"something = 1/1000000000000 of something (reference 5)

299792 kps (kilometers per second) (reference 6)



In one nanosecond = 11.802 inches (reference 7)

In one microsecond = 983.571 feet (reference 7)

In one millisecond = 186.282 miles (reference 7)

In one second = 186282.024 miles (reference 7)

In one second = 47 times around the Earth! (reference 7)



Manufacturing Process = 22 nm (reference 8)

Transistor Count = 1.4 billion transistors (reference 8)

Die Size = 177 mm^2 (reference 8)



time for a signal to move between transistors = picoseconds



Time until the counter "rolls over" = years
